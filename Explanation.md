- We're gonna create a online back up our code using git and github.

- Much like Google drive, we want to upload our code in the cloud and download it from cloud when it's needed. 

- Secondly it should let us download the special folder from the cloud, if we make any changes to the folder, then it also should added and updated in the cloud. 

- The third thing that the cloud service should do is to update the special folder in the local computer whenever something is added to the cloud. 

- This feature is called 2-way sync, we're gonna implement this feature using git & github. 

Note: Git repository is a folder that is being tracked by the git. 

- Github is specifically designed for git repositories, it allows us to manage our code and verison history. 

- We are gonna create a new repository in the github, and save our code in the repository.

- Go to github website, click on the icon, then click your repository. click new, create repository name and then create repository at the end. 

- Now we have two repository, one is the local repository which is the current file. The other is remote repository which is in github.

- Now, we're gonna upload the local repository to our remote repository.
